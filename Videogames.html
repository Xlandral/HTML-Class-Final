            <p2>It's a very enjoyable game. If you're questioning getting it. Think of every survival game out there and think to yourself if you want to add water and a level of difficulty which is hard to start out with. Playing this game (mainly offline) was fun. But one thing I do have to say is that it is not updated much. I feel like its development has stopped being a priority. It would be a much more enjoyable game if there was more content available. But the game is still very enjoyable as it is.

            <p2>Civ 5 is better, It doesn't make anything super new but I have been looking for a new game like this for a while and have been super hyped. I love this and can't wait to see what the expansions will bring.
